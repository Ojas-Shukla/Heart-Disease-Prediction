# Heart-Disease-Prediction
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early and
accurate prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce
mortality. Traditional diagnosis methods are time-consuming and often require
expensive tests.
Given a set of medical parameters collected from patients—such as age, sex,
chest pain type, cholesterol level, blood pressure, ECG results, and more—can we
develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies whether a patient is
likely to have heart disease?
The goal is to build and compare several classification models such as Logistic
Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc to predict the presence of heart disease based on the given features.</p>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
* To develop a supervised classification model that predicts whether a patient
has heart disease (target: 0 or 1).<br>
* To compare the performance of multiple models:<br>
    <pre>
    1. Logistic Regression<br>
    2.Decision Tree<br>
    3.Random Forest<br>
    </pre>
* To evaluate models using classification metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall,
F1-Score, ROC-AUC.</p>
